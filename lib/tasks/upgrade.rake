# This will grant a group's access to its members.
# This is for the migration to core's castle_gates permission system to work
# with data created before this system was added.
#
# If we wanted to migrate group (or user) profile settings, we could do that here.
#
# Instead, currently, all groups (and users) will be set to most restrictive permission settings.
#
# This task should only need to be run once. However, running it again shouldn't hurt.
