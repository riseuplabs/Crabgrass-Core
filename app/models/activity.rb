# = Activity
#
# Activities are used to populate the recent activity list on the dashboard.
# They are usually created by using track_action in the controllers which
# hands the current state to Tracking::Action.track
# (see Common::Tracking::Action in controllers and Tracking::Action in models)
# Activities will show up on the subjects landing page.
#
# == Database Schema:
#
#  create_table "activities", :force => true do |t|
#    t.integer  "subject_id",   :limit => 11
#    t.string   "subject_type"
#    t.string   "subject_name"
#    t.integer  "item_id",    :limit => 11
#    t.string   "item_type"
#    t.string   "item_name"
#    t.string   "type"
#    t.string   "extra"
#    t.integer  "related_id",
#    t.integer  "key",          :limit => 11
#    t.datetime "created_at"
#    t.integer  "access",       :limit => 1,  :default => 2
#    t.integer  "site_id",      :limite => 11
#  end

#
# related_id and extra are used for generic storage and association, whatever
# the subclass wants to use it for.
