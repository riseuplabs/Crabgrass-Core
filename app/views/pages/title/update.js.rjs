#
# the problem:
#
# If the page name has changed, this has invalidated many of the existing page
# links based on the name. Ideally, most links should use the page id, but some
# do not.
#
# the solution:
#
# Replace the page name in all links with the class page_url. This should work
# even if the page and the context have the same name or if there are nasty
# chars in the title.
