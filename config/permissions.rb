#
# There are two types of permission in Crabgrass:
#
#   (1) model permissions
#       low level permissions, stored in db, defined in this file.
#
#   (2) controller/view permissions
#       higher level permissions, based on methods, built on model permissions,
#       and defined in /app/permissions
#
# Entity permissions
# -------------------------------
#
# These permissions are common to both users and groups.
#
#   view    -- show the profile 'home' page for the entity.
#   pester  -- send an entity notifications, typically about pages.
#   burden  -- share with an entity a page
#   spy     -- track activity of the entity, like join grp or when logged in
#   comment -- post a comment to the entity's public message board
#
