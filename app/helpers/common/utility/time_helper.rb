  # friendly_date()
  #
  # Our goal here it to automatically display the date in the way that
  # makes the most sense. Elusive, i know. If an array of times is passed in
  # we display the newest one.
  #
  # Here are the current options:
  #
  #   4:30PM    -- time was today
  #   Wednesday -- time was within the last week.
  #   Mar 7     -- time was in the current year (depends on current locale)
  #   Mar 7 08  -- time was in a different year (depends on current locale)
  #
  # The date is then wrapped in a label, so that if you hover over the text
  # you will see the full details.
  #
  # NOTE: unfortunately, I think this method is incredibly slow, adding about 100ms
  # if called on a table of dates. I don't think this is avoidable: formatting times
  # just takes a lot of logic.

  ## this does NOT actually expire the fragment cache, but it makes it invalid
  ## after three hours, which is just as good so long as you have an external
  ## job that cleans up after old files.
