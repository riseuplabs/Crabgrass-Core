# A Federating holds the data relating to an association between a group and a network.
#
# Optionally, each end of a federating can specify which specific subgroup
# of the group will have membership in the council of the networks.
#
# council     -- the subgroup of the network that is a council (ie admin group)
# delegation  -- the delegation is a subgroup of the group joining the network.
#                every member of the delegation will be made a member of the
#                council.
