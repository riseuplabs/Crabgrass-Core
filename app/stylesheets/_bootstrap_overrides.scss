//
// The default display for bootstrap's .pagination is line-block.
// but inline-block elements are not allowed to collapse margins.
// I am not sure what the advantage of inline-block was.
// Setting this to block allows margins to collapse nicely, but the
// clearfix is needed because of all the floats on the li elements.
//
// This hack seems to work reliably in firefox and chrome. Not
// yet tested in IE.

.pagination {
  display: block;
  @include clearfix;
}
