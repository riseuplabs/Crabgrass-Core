# WikiLock objects are protected by optimistic locking
# this means that if two users load the same WikiLock
# the first one will be able to save it, the second one will get a StaleObject exception on save

# Note: WikiLock has no concept of section hierarchy!
# this means that if :document is locked for user 'blue'
# a subsection of :document will appear open to a different user
# Always use WikiExtension::Locking methods for manipulating wiki locks
# since those methods take section hierarchy into account
