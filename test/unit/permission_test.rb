  # This test uses user.clear_access_cache. This is needed after a structure change because the user object has
  # in-memory cached the previous results.
  #
  # Changing the org structure clears the cache in the db, but not in memory. This is typically OK in practice,
  # because after the org structure change the app does not do further permission checks. But for tests,
  # we need to manually fetch a new user object or call clear_access_cache.
